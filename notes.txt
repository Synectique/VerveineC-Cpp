struct == class ???
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_classes
In C++, a structure is a class defined with the struct keyword. Its members and base classes are public by default. A class defined with the class keyword has private members and base classes by default. This is the only difference between structs and classes in C++.
